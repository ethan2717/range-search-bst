Usage
Navigate to the appropriate directory in the terminal.
Run the "make" command to compile the code.
Execute the program by running the command "./wordrange <INPUT_FILE> <OUTPUT_FILE>".

The program reads the commands in from the input file. 
The initial letter represents an operation -- either 
insert or range. The subsequent string(s) represent(s) 
the value on which to operate. "Insert" puts the given 
value into the binary search tree. "Range" returns the 
number of items between the two given boundaries. The 
results of the range function are then outputted to 
the output file.

File description
Makefile: contains the commands to compile the program
bst.h: contains declarations for the bst class
bst.cpp: contains implementations for the bst class
wordrange.cpp: contains the main program to interpret 
the input file, create the binary search tree, and 
output the results of the range function
